                    <p><b>Food insecurity</b> is defined by the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/I7695e/I7695e.pdf">UN
                            FAO</a> as the <i>“situation when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe
                            and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life.”</i>
                        Severe food insecurity results in undernourishment and hunger. Causes of severe food insecurity
                        include food being
                        unavailable or unaffordable, and unbalanced distribution of food among households.

                        observed regional inequalities, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, are a result of political
                        conflict (a leading cause of
                        famine), and is compounded by the climate (which can cause drought and flood conditions).</p> -->

                        <h3>The other side of hunger: Obesity</h3>
                        <p>While lack of food causes undernourishment, unhealthy diets can lead to <b>obesity</b> and
                            diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. The
                            causes of obesity go beyond poor eating
                            habits, and factors such as overconsumption and limited access to quality food play a part.
                            Nutritional intake in the first
                            1000 days of a child’s life is also a risk factor.
                            With rapid urbanization,
                            people are increasingly consuming packaged and fast foods and living a sedentary lifestyle.

                            Child Growth Standards</a>. The cause is related to poor
                        nutrition, feeding
                        practices and inadequate sanitary conditions. Fortunately, wasting can be treated through
